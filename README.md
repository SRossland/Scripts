# Scripts
Random Program Made During Grad School

Most of these scripts were created in response to the analysis of the background components of NuSTAR in an effort to make a measurement of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). One ancillary effect from this study was the use of the new background model created for NuSTAR's background components to attempt to measure the 3.5 keV line as it may be the signatory line from the decay of massive neutrinos, a dark matter candidate.
